## Section 1: The Problem

### Heading
**Solar Sales Teams Waste Half Their Day on Leads That Will Never Convert**

### Body
Your reps dial 80-120 leads a day. Fewer than 15% pick up. When they do, your rep is improvising — no context on the property, no talk track, no idea if this lead is even a homeowner.

Meanwhile, the leads that *would* convert are aging out because nobody ranked them.

And the compliance risk is real. TCPA lawsuits average $1,500 per violation. One bad campaign can cost more than a quarter's revenue.

Generic outreach tools make it faster to do the wrong thing. SolarCommand makes it possible to do the right thing — at scale.

## Section 2: How It Works

### Heading
**From CSV to Appointment in Four Steps**

### Step 1: Ingest & Score
Upload your lead list or connect your source. SolarCommand scores every property on 10 solar-specific factors: roof age, roof area, ownership status, home value, utility rate zone, shade coverage, neighborhood solar adoption, household income, property type, and existing solar. Each lead gets a 0-100 Solar Readiness Score with a full breakdown your reps can see.

### Step 2: Enrich & Validate
For your hottest leads, we automatically enrich contact data — additional phone numbers, email addresses, job titles, LinkedIn profiles — and validate what's already on file. Phone type, carrier, line status, email deliverability. Your reps call real numbers.

### Step 3: Outreach with Compliance Built In
SolarCommand selects the best channel (voice, SMS, or email) based on time of day, attempt history, and consent status. Quiet hours, DNC lists, opt-out processing, and attempt limits are enforced automatically — not left to rep discipline. Every outreach attempt is logged.

### Step 4: AI Operator Closes the Loop
After every conversation, the AI operator generates a summary, runs a 9-point compliance QA review, extracts objections, and recommends the Next Best Action. Your reps start the next day with a ranked list, a talk track, and objection handlers — prepared, not guessing.

## Section 3: What Makes This Different

### Heading
**Built for Solar. Not Another LLM Wrapper.**

### Comparison Grid

**Solar-Specific Scoring**
Generic tools use demographic data or none at all. SolarCommand scores on roof age, utility zone, shade coverage, and neighborhood adoption — signals that actually predict solar conversion.

**Compliance by Default**
Most tools add a disclaimer and call it done. SolarCommand enforces TCPA quiet hours, scrubs DNC lists, tracks consent with evidence chains, detects opt-outs deterministically (keyword matching, not AI interpretation), and QA-reviews every conversation against a 9-point checklist.

**Transparent AI**
Every AI call is logged: input prompt, output, model, temperature, token count, cost, and latency. Your compliance team can audit any decision in under a minute. When the AI is unavailable, the system falls back to deterministic defaults — it never guesses.

**Suggest-Only by Default**
The AI recommends actions; humans approve them. Auto-mode exists but is off by default. This is a design choice for teams that need to trust the system before they hand it the keys.

**Cost You Can See**
Every voice minute, SMS segment, AI token, and enrichment lookup is tracked to the penny and visible in your admin dashboard. Batch limits and spend caps prevent surprises.

**Organizational Memory**
The system learns from your operation — which objections come up in which counties, which scripts convert, which reps handle which pushback best. That context feeds back into every AI recommendation, getting sharper over time.

## Section 4: Outcomes

### Heading
**Measurable Results, Not Promises**

### Outcome 1: Higher Connect Rate
Reps call the highest-scored leads first, during the right window, on a validated number. Contact enrichment fills gaps before the first dial. Teams typically move from 15% to 25%+ connect rates.

### Outcome 2: Fewer Wasted Site Visits
The score breakdown flags disqualifiers early — renters, existing solar, heavy shade, small roofs. Pre-qualification means reps visit homes that are actually viable. 30-40% reduction in no-value appointments.

### Outcome 3: Controlled, Predictable Cost
No invoice surprises. Every cost is tracked and visible. You set the batch limits and spend caps. The admin dashboard shows exactly what you're spending on AI, voice, SMS, and enrichment — updated in real time.

### Outcome 4: Compliance You Can Defend
Automated QA catches issues before they become lawsuits. Consent logs with evidence chains satisfy audits. Opt-out processing is deterministic. When a regulator asks about a specific lead, you pull the audit log and show them — every action, every timestamp, every decision.

## Section 5: The AI Operator

### Heading
**An AI That Works for Your Team — Not Around Them**

### Body
SolarCommand's AI operator runs on Anthropic's Claude and handles the work your reps shouldn't be doing manually:

**SMS Classification** — Inbound messages are classified by intent (interested, opt-out, question, appointment request) with suggested replies. Opt-outs are caught deterministically before AI even runs.

**Rep Briefs** — Before a call, the AI generates a 30-second brief: property summary, talk track, likely objections, and recommended approach. Your rep walks in prepared.

**Next Best Action** — For every active lead, the AI recommends: who to contact, when, via which channel, and why. Hard rules (DNC, quiet hours, terminal status) are enforced first; AI reasoning handles the nuance.

**Compliance QA** — Every conversation is reviewed against a 9-point checklist: disclosure, opt-out respect, no false claims, proper consent handling. Flagged conversations surface in the admin queue.

**Script Optimization** — The AI analyzes objection patterns and suggests script edits with expected impact. A/B testing tracks which version converts better.

**Weekly Insights** — A narrative summary of your operation: what's working, what's not, where to focus. Delivered to the dashboard every Monday.

## Section 7: FAQs

### How long does setup take?
Most teams are live in under a week. You upload a CSV or connect your lead source, configure scoring weights for your market, connect Twilio for voice and SMS, and load your scripts. The AI operator starts learning from day one.

### Do I need to change my CRM?
No. SolarCommand works alongside your existing CRM. You can export data, use the API, or integrate directly on the Enterprise tier. Most teams use SolarCommand as their lead intelligence layer and keep their CRM for contract management.

### How does compliance actually work?
Compliance is enforced at three layers. First, the outreach orchestrator checks DNC, consent, quiet hours, and attempt limits before any contact is made. Second, opt-out detection uses deterministic keyword matching — not AI — so "STOP" is always honored instantly. Third, every conversation is QA-reviewed by the AI against a 9-point compliance checklist. Flagged conversations surface in the admin queue. Every action is logged in an append-only audit trail.

### What happens if the AI goes down?
The system falls back to deterministic defaults. Leads are still scored, outreach still respects compliance rules, and the queue still processes. The AI layer adds intelligence — it doesn't gate-keep the workflow. When the API comes back, processing resumes automatically.

### Can the AI send messages or make calls without approval?
Not by default. SolarCommand ships in suggest-only mode. The AI recommends actions; a human approves them. You can enable auto-mode for specific actions (like low-risk SMS replies) when you're ready, but that's your decision.

### What data do you store, and where?
All data is stored in your PostgreSQL database — either self-hosted or managed. We don't send lead data to third parties except when you explicitly trigger enrichment (PDL, Melissa) or AI classification (Anthropic). AI prompts are sanitized to remove PII injection risks, and Anthropic does not train on API data.

### How is this different from [competitor]?
Most AI outreach tools are generic — they generate messages but don't understand solar-specific signals. SolarCommand scores on roof age, utility zone, shade, and neighborhood adoption. More importantly, we log every AI decision with full input/output transparency. Most tools can't answer "why did the AI say that?" — we can, in under a minute.

### What if I just want scoring and enrichment, no AI outreach?
That's the Starter tier. You get lead scoring and SMS classification without voice or enrichment automation. Add capabilities when you're ready.
